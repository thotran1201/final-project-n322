For my final project, I created an app for both avid and inexperienced travelers, and historians that talks about the facts on the Catacombs of Domitilla, which is located under Rome, Italy. What I utilized is mainly on Ionic Angular, but also with JS and CRUD application. However, some is SCSS, which comes with the project. In all three tab pages, the background color is an RGB for red "Rome" to give the Ancient Rome and Roman Christian history vibes, while all the buttons are ion color "danger" and a font is Helvetica. I will concisely break down the details in all three tabs:

- In tab 1 is the home page. In there, there are couple of selections including the bottom tabs that you can select: "ART" and "QUESTIONS." Unfortunately, the tab on top of the bottom tabs weren't working. So, I have to tap on the three selections to go to another pages.
- In tab 2 is the art page. This page contains all the Roman Christian artworks, mainly murals with dates, materials and facts about each murals. When inspecting the page, it will show that the second page looks like a mobile. To construct that, I used ion cards to make the page professionally instead of lay those photos and then clicked on one of the artworks with javascript.
- In tab 3 is the questions page. This page is mainly on asking any questions you would wish to ask about the Catacombs of Domitilla and the art history itself. From there, you can submit the question and the question will show up on the page. If you wish to update the question, just type down the question to update it and the squared tab will automatically show up. If you wish to delete the question, simply tap the delete button. Overall, this is called the CRUD application aka Create, Read, Update, and Delete application. To construct, I coded with JS in the tab3page.ts using const, var, for loops, etc. Some JS components are in the HTML page on the tab3 itself.
However, there is one obstacle when running the page. There is a bug that disrupts the page when inspecting it and then refresh the page. I would either getting out from the inspect section and refresh the page or to go to terminal and type "ionic serve" to do that.
Just to note here: I chose this project to prep myself to what it looks like when I am working on my Capstone project on "Indy Historical." This is like a prep version to what it looks like before I'm getting started on my final project piece for Capstone next semester.
