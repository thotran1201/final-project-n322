      The Catacombs of Domitilla on the Via Appia Antica in Rome (named after Saint Domitilla) spread over 17 kilometres of underground caves. They are the oldest of Rome's underground burial networks, and the only ones to still contain bones. They are also the best preserved and one of the most extensive of all the catacombs. Included in their passages are a 2nd-century fresco of the Last Supper and other valuable artifacts.

      A very ancient part of the Catacombs of Domitilla is the hypogeum of the Flavi. This originated at the end of the second century A.D. as a private, pagan hypogeum which later, during the third century, housed Christian tombs decorated with scenes from Sacred Scripture.

      The picture shows the view of the apse of the chamber of the millers in the catacombs of Domitilla. As well as scenes illustrating the activities of the deceased, the most prominent position in the apse was taken up by individual depictions with theological themes.

      The Catacombs of Domitilla on Via Ardeatina, as we know them, are spread over 17 kilometres of underground caves, some of which are inaccessible. They are laid out on four levels - one on top of another. We know from inscriptions that the land originally belonged to Flavia Domitilla. She was a noblewoman - the Emperor Vespasian was her grandfather and Domitian was her uncle. The catacomb was discovered in 1593 by the first modern explorer of Christian cemeteries, Antonio Bosio. At that time, Bosio believed he was in a part of the vast catacomb of St Calixtus. It was only in the 19th century that Giovanni Battista de Rossi (1822-1894), founder of Christian archeology, understood this was really the catacomb of St Domitilla and the sanctuary of the martyrs Nereus and Achilleus. The chamber of the millers in the catacombs of Domitilla has murals from the late 4th century. The apse is decorated with an image of the Good Shepherd surrounded by depictions of the seasons. The inscription above the pedestal contains information on the activities of the millers, as well as those of the surveyors.

      The photo shows the arcosolium (an arched cell designed to receive a sarcophagus) of Veneranda in the catacombs of Domitilla. The fresco decoration of the grave from the second half of the fourth century shows the entry of the deceased (named Veneranda) into heaven accompanied by the martyr Petronella. This scene shows the expectations bound up with an 'ad sanctos' burial - that is a burial close to the grave of a venerated martyr.

      A painting, in which Petronilla is represented as receiving a deceased person (named Veneranda) into heaven, was discovered on the closing stone of a tomb in an underground crypt. Beside the saint's picture is her name: Petronilla Mart. (yr). That the painting was done shortly after 356, is proved by an inscription found in the tomb.
